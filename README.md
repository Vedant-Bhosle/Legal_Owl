# Legal Owl
For the proper functioning of a democracy, a key element is access to legal aid and justice for all, irrespective of caste, gender, and economic background. Which is why there should be more options for people living in rural areas or from marginalised communities to seek legal advice or other services. This absence of legal security is caused by a lack of understanding or awareness about the proceedings and a lack of access to legal services. This creates a need for a system that would be easily accessible to users and help them get legal advice for their queries, as well as raise awareness about legal procedures amongst the people. We aim to develop a system using which a layman-understandable summary of the official case judgement documents would be provided, by which the common person could understand the situation they are facing by looking at previous experiences. This would be a step towards developing a generative AI system that would provide legal advice to the user by analysing similar cases and related laws.
